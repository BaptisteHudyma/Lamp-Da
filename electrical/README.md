# Electrical manufacturing

The circuit has 134 component in total:
- 58 unique components
- 1 BGA

For manufacture, use the following parameters:
- 4 layers
- dimention 44x44mm
- 1.6mm thickness
- Material FR-4
- minimum hole size 0.3mm
- minimum track/spacing 4/4mil
- Surface finish ENIG (immersion gold 1U") : needed for BGA
- tented vias. No need to fill them, no via in pad
- 1oz copper. Can be more for top and bottom layer, but not needed


Manufacturing those are expensive: about 7200 us$ for 300 units, so about 24$ per unit.
Another test with a previous similar version : about 700$ for 10 units, so about 70$ per unit for small batches.
