- physical: stuf related to the physical components: button, bluetooth, IMU, ...
    - LSM6DS3: library to talk to the IMU. Adapted to this architecture
    - battery.h: handle the battery readings, for battery level
    - button.h: control the button. Takes callbacks for actions on multiple button pushes. Used to display stuf on the button if needed
    - fileSystem.h: handle the reading and writting of variables to memory
    - IMU.h: the imu related operations
    - indicator.h: visual indicator controler (led in the button)
    - output_power.h: interface of the output voltage driver
    - sound.h: microphone main input point. Compute FFT and auto disable
