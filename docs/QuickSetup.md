# Quick Setup

First clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BaptisteHudyma/Lamp-Da.git LampColorControler
cd LampColorControler
git submodule update --init
```

This project uses the Arduino SDK, you will need to install several
dependencies before being able to build the project and upload your
firmware.

## Useful Linux packages

For reference, if you are on a `Debian/Linux (debian12,bookworm)` system, here
is a list of packages that you may need to use this project:

 - `build-essential gcc g++ clang clang-format make cmake git` for development
 - `python3 python3-venv python-is-python3` to flash the board & use tools
 - optionally, if you want to build the simulator:

    - `libsfml-dev` if you are on a platform that have `SFML 3.0.1`
      (e.g. `sid` or `experimental`)
    - `libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libudev-dev` and
      `libfreetype-dev libvorbis-dev libflac-dev` if you only have `SFML 2.6.2`
      or lower available, as the simulator build system will try to download
      and compile the last SFML version from source.

Depending on your setup (Ubuntu, WSL, Fedora, Archlinux, â€¦) you may need to
install other packages, such as `arduino-cli` or `arduino-ide` as described
below.

## Arduino Setup

You will need to:

 - Install the Arduino IDE and verify that `arduino-cli` is accessible in path
 - Install the Adafruit nRF52 board support (version 1.6.1) [as described here](https://github.com/BaptisteHudyma/LampDa_nRF52_Arduino?tab=readme-ov-file#recommended-adafruit-nrf52-bsp-via-the-arduino-board-manager)
 - Replace the content of the `$HOME/.arduino15/packages/adafruit/hardware/nrf52` by the content of the [above repository](https://github.com/BaptisteHudyma/LampDa_nRF52_Arduino)
 - Install [`adafruit-nrfutil`](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_nrfutil) from PyPI
 - Install the [`Adafruit Neopixel`](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/adafruit-neopixel) and
   [`arduinofft`](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/arduinofft/) libraries

To check that `arduino-cli` is available in path, you can run:

```sh
arduino-cli version
```

If your system does not package `arduino-cli` or if it's not working for you,
you may try the following recipe to make it available locally:

```sh
# also download+install arduino-cli in $SRC_DIR/_build/arduino-cli/
cd LampColorControler
make arduino-cli-download safe-install
```

Now that `arduino-cli` is available, if you find yourself in trouble
installing the Arduino dependencies by hand, you can use the following
to install everything locally:

```sh
# download+install all dependencies (~1.4Go) in $SRC_DIR/_build/arduino-cli/
cd LampColorControler
make safe-install
```

## Building the project

Once all dependencies are set up, you will be able to build the project
as follows:

```sh
# build project assuming simple lamp type
cd LampColorControler
make simple
```

If you are working on the `indexable` variant of the lamp, you
can use:

```sh
# build project assuming simple lamp type
cd LampColorControler
make indexable
```

When changing lamp type or adding a new file to the sketch, use:

```sh
cd LampColorControler
make clean
make indexable
```

You can also use the `clean-artifacts` recipe to remove only the output
binaries, and to only rebuild what is necessary:

```sh
# remove build artifacts & rebuild the project
cd LampColorControler
make clean-artifacts {simple,cct,indexable} # pick one
```

## Uploading to board

After plugging your board, you should be able to upload as follows:

```sh
# use upload-indexable if you are working with indexable
cd LampColorControler
make upload-simple
```

Note that `upload-{simple,cct,indexable}` checks that you have build the
associated `{simple,cct,indexable}` recipe, and that you may get an error
message if you are mixing up the different versions.

You may need to configure the serial port of the board before uploading:

```sh
# by default LMBD_SERIAL_PORT is /dev/ttyACM0
cd LampColorControler
LMBD_SERIAL_PORT=/dev/ttyACM1 make upload-simple
```

Once your board is running, to connect to its serial monitor, use:

```sh
# use LMBD_SERIAL_PORT as above to configure the serial port
cd LampColorControler
make monitor
```

If you have a `virtualenv` somewhere with `adafruit-nrfutil` already
installed, you may setup a link to explicitly use it:

```sh
# the Makefile will source $SRC_DIR/venv/bin/activate
cd LampColorControler
ln -s venv path/to/other/virtualenv
make clean-artifacts upload-indexable
```

## Building the documentation

To build the documentation, you must have `doxygen` installed:

```sh
# use "make clean-doc doc" to force documentation rebuild
cd LampColorControler
make doc
```

You will be able to preview the documentation as follows:

```sh
$(BROWSER) ./docs/html/index.html
```

## Building the simulator

If you want simulate a view of an "indexable mode" animation and have the
[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) installed:

```sh
cd LampColorControler
make simulator
./_build/simulator/indexable-simulator
```

This may build the SFML library if `SFML 3.0.1` is not available locally, and
it will fail if some of the required dependencies are missing.

Note that the compiler used is `/usr/bin/c++` by default, and as we are using
modern C++17 features as well as things like `-fconcepts` you will require an
up-to-date local compiler -- here "up-to-date" typically means something from
2020 :)

## Cleaning up

There are several `clean-*` recipes available:

```sh
# "quick" clean recipes
make clean-artifacts # removes output build artifacts, use it to force rebuild
make clean-doc # removes output "index.html" artifact, use it to force rebuild
make clean-simulator # removes simulator artifacts, use it to force rebuild :)

# "full" clean recipes
make clean # must be called when changing LAMP_TYPE, or if you added a .cpp file
```

Once you're finished with your work on the project:

```sh
# this removes build artifacts AND all local dependencies
cd LampColorControler
make mr_proper
```

Note that this last method WILL remove all the locally installed dependencies,
that may be very expensive to install again (more than a gigabyte of setup).
